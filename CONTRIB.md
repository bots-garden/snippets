# tools

To ease your work on the project, a set of tasks have been defined using the tool [Task](https://taskfile.dev/).  
The installation is as easy and very well described in the [documentation of Task](https://taskfile.dev/installation/).  

If you use VS Code, you can then use the extension [task.vscode-task](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=task.vscode-task)  
For other tools, see the [documentation on integration](https://taskfile.dev/integrations/)
